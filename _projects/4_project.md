##### Project year: 2023

As I delved into the world of deep learning, I discovered that the medical field is a great use case for this technology. With various applications helping to detect diseases and aid physicians in making diagnoses, I wanted to use my skills to contribute to this field. That's why I chose to work on a Breast Cancer Classification project, where I trained a model to classify cancer subtypes based on 2D Medical Histopathology images. This project helped me learn how to use deep learning algorithms to solve real-world medical problems, and it was rewarding to know that my work could potentially save time and reduce errors in hospitals.

As I progressed, I realized that Natural Language Processing (NLP) is another field where deep learning is widely used. With NLP, I didn't have to deal with images but instead with words and sentences. That's when I decided to tackle the Disaster Tweet project on Kaggle in the NLP category. This project required me to classify Twitter Tweets and predict if they are about real disasters or not. This was an excellent opportunity for me to learn about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using Pytorch.

Overall, these projects have helped me develop my skills in deep learning and broaden my understanding of its applications in different fields. I feel confident in my ability to implement and fine-tune deep learning models for various projects and look forward to exploring more challenging use cases in the future.
