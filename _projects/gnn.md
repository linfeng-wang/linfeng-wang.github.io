Developed a graph attention network (GAT) model that integrates phylogenetic tree structure and SNP presence to detect positively selected mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Leveraged attention-based deep learning to focus on topologically informative regions within evolutionary graphs, enhancing interpretability and biological relevance.

Achieved strong performance, and identified high-confidence adaptive mutations previously classified as uncertain by WHO.

Demonstrated the modelâ€™s capability to uncover novel resistance markers and support long-term genomic surveillance in TB.
