##### Project year: 2023


During this project, I learned a lot about the process of loading and formatting image data for use in deep learning models. I also had the opportunity to practice implementing a binary classification model and experimenting with different hyperparameters to improve its performance. Additionally, I learned about transfer learning and how it can be used to improve the accuracy of a model even with limited training data. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience for me, allowing me to apply my knowledge of deep learning in a real-world context and gain new insights into the field. I am proud of the results I achieved and the skills I developed, and I look forward to applying them in future projects.
