##### Project year: 2023

Through this project, I had the opportunity to learn and practice building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using TensorFlow and PyTorch. I gained a deeper understanding of how CNNs work and how to tune the hyperparameters to achieve better performance. Working with CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 10 different classes of color images, provided a more challenging task than my previous project, but I enjoyed the process of building a more complex model. Overall, this project allowed me to gain valuable experience in deep learning and image classification, and I am excited to apply these skills to future projects.
