I built a website using Django, a Python-based web framework that provides a solid foundation for building web applications quickly and easily. I started by designing the website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a visually appealing user interface. 

Overall, building this website using Django allowed me to hone my skills in web development, It was a great learning experience and I am excited to continue building more complex web applications in the future.
