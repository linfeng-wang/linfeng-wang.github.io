<h4>TB-profiler workshop</h4> 
<h5>2023 - LSHTM (UK)</h5>
I have successfully delivered a course and workshop on the "Application of Bioinformatics in Infectious Disease Research" where I covered the principles and practical application of various bioinformatics tools and techniques for studying infectious diseases. This course aimed to equip participants with the necessary skills to perform computational analysis of infectious disease data and interpret the results. Additionally, I introduced the participants to the tool tb-profiler, which is a widely used bioinformatics tool for analyzing drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Overall, the course was well-received by the participants, and I am proud to have contributed to their professional development in the field of infectious disease research.<br />

<h4>Python coding workshop</h4>
<h5>2022 - LSHTM (UK)</h5>
Experience teaching Python programming to beginners, including the use of the NumPy library and various basic Python uses. In particular, I have taught a Python coding course in a classroom setting, where I was responsible for developing and delivering the course content to a group of students with diverse backgrounds and skill levels. In addition to teaching in the classroom, I also ran a workshop focused on practical applications of Python and NumPy. Through these experiences, I have developed strong communication and teaching skills, as well as a deep understanding of Python programming and its various applications.<br />

<h4>Pathogen Genomics workshop</h4>
<h5>2022 - Royal Veterinary College (UK) </h5>
<h5> 2023 - Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (Philippines)</h5>
I have had the opportunity to teach the genomics course developed by Jody Phelan. The course provides a comprehensive overview of genomics and its application in research. As an instructor, I was responsible for teaching and mentoring students in the fundamentals of genomics, including the principles of sequencing, data analysis, and interpretation. The course is designed to provide students with a practical understanding of genomics and to equip them with the necessary skills to apply these concepts to their own research. Through this experience, I have honed my skills in teaching complex scientific concepts to students of diverse backgrounds and have gained valuable experience in developing and delivering course materials.

As a part of my contribution I have also designed a deep learning workshop where I introduced the basic principle of deep learning and demonstrate a CNN model for predicting TB drug resistance from TB DNA sequence.
