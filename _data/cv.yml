        - 5-month rotation with Dr Matt Silver on Nutritional Epidemiology.

          contents:
            - <b>Background:</b> Methylation is a common type of epigenetic modification. It is the addition of a methyl group to DNA sequences. They play an important role in the differentiation of tissue and germ layers by selectively controlling the expression of different genes and affecting transposable elements. I performed statistical analysis to identify methylations that affect foetal development and give rise to different phenotypes, I also performed analysis to find the effect of these methylations and on biological activity.
            - <b>Methods:</b> R programming, PCR, linear regression, Correlation test, enrichment analysis
    
    - title: Master of Research project

      year: 2020 - 2021
      description:
        - 12-month Master of Research project with Dr Jonathan Wojciechowski and Dr Eoghan Cunnane supervised by prof Molly Stevens.
        - title: <b>Research Topic:</b> <i>Design of an Artificial Bruchs Membrane from Synthetic Polyesters.</i>
          contents:
            - <b>Background:</b> During transplantation of retinal progenitor epithelium (RPE) cells to treat retinal degeneration, an optimised delivery system is required to achieve an appropriate cellular organisation that simple bolus injection is unable to provide. I developed polymers with controllable degradation rates and optimised electrospinning for fibrous scaffold formation for RPE transplantation to treat macular degeneration. 
            - <b>Methods:</b> polymer Synthesis (ROP), Electrospinning, SEM, NMR, data processing/visualisation using python, Image J, in vitro degradation.
    - title: Bachelor of Science final year project
      institution: King's College London, London, UK
      year: Sep 2018 – Jan 2019
      description:
        - 5-month Undergraduate final year project with Dr Andrew Beavil, King’s College London.
        - title: <b>Research Topic:</b> <i>Investigation of Concordance Between Molecular Dynamics Simulation and FRET Biosensor using Designed Protein Linker System.
          contents:
            - <b>Background:</b> Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor systems are assays developed to measure the separation between one ‘donor’ fluorophore in the presence of another ‘acceptor’ fluorophore. Molecular dynamics simulation was used in this project to predict the exact conformational states. I tested the system using inter-domain linkers with self-designed rigid or flexible properties both experimentally and computationally
            - <b>Methods:</b> protein design, molecular cloning, plasmid DNA purification, protein purification, TCSPC spectroscopy and molecular dynamic simulations, Gel electrophoresis, PCR
    - title: Bachelor of Science summer project
      institution: King's College London, London, UK
      year: Jun 2018 – Aug 2018
      description:
        - 2-month summer project working in the Laboratory of Dr Eugene Makeyev, King’s College London, funded by Wellcome Trust Biomedical Vocational Studentship.
        - title: <b>Research Topic:</b> <i>How nonsense-mediated decay contributes to gene regulation in developing neurons?
          contents:
            - <b>Background:</b> Protein PTBP1 represses the inclusion of AS-NMD (alternative splicing induced non-sense-mediated decay), inducing alternative exons in dozens of previously unknown targets, which play important roles in stem cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. I tested the hypothesis that PTBP1-regulated AS-NMD events are critical for proper differentiation of stem cells into neurons.
            - <b>Methods:</b> Gel electrophoresis, PCR, qPCR, bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data, mammalian cell cultures, reverse transcription, molecular cloning; RNA purification, primer design
