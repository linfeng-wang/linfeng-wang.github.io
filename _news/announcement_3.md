During my visit to RITM in the Philippines, not only did I have the opportunity to run a genomic course and teach bioinformatics to passionate researchers, but I was also deeply moved by the realities of disease development and transmission in the country. It was heart-wrenching to see the impact of TB on the local population and to witness firsthand the challenges that healthcare professionals face in controlling its spread. This experience has ignited in me a desire to continue working with my collaborators in the Philippines and to contribute to finding solutions to this pressing issue. I feel inspired and energized by the dedication and enthusiasm of the people I met during my visit, and I am committed to using my skills and expertise to help combat TB transmission and improve the health and well-being of communities in the Philippines and beyond.


In addition to my visit to RITM, I also had the opportunity to visit the University of the Philippines (UP) and meet with some of their researchers. This experience further reinforced my passion for teaching and helping people. The collaboration with the researchers at UP allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges they face in their research and how I can contribute to their work through teaching and training. It was a great honor to work with such talented individuals, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have made a positive impact in their research. Overall, my experience in the Philippines has inspired me to continue working and collaborating in this field, and I look forward to future opportunities to contribute to research and education efforts in the country.

I found my time in visit incredibly fulfilling, and I realized that I have a passion for teaching and helping people. I enjoyed sharing my knowledge of bioinformatics and genomics with the participants and was inspired by their research and dedication. Seeing their enthusiasm for learning and research was truly motivating, and it made me realize that teaching is something that I truly love to do. I am grateful for the opportunity to have collaborated with such a talented and dedicated team, and I am excited to continue working with them and other collaborators in the future.
